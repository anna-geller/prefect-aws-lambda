# Event-driven Dataflow with AWS Lambda and Prefect

This project demonstrates how to deploy several Prefect flows to serverless AWS Lambda functions.

Some of those are scheduled, others are triggered by S3 put object event - all of that can be easily configured via YAML configuration thanks to the serverless framework.
